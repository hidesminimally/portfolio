  <h5> What is Hypnos? </h5>
  <p>
  Hynpos: your personal meditation assistant. Hypnos gently guides you through various themed sessions on everything from stress to sleep. It only takes a few minutes to change the rest of your day with Hypnos. Hypnos offers bite-sized meditations to try when you're too busy, and offers specific meditative sessions based on your emotional state.
    <br> <br>
  Anxious? Hypnos provides meditation that has been shown to reduce both daily stress and perceived stress.[1]
    <br> <br>
  Stay focused! Routine meditation has been proven to show improvements in attention, focus and the ability to ignore distractions. [2]

  <h5> Motivation: </h5>
  <br> <br>
  <p>I’ve always had trouble falling asleep. Often times, if I’m tossing and turning for longer than 20 minutes, I just pop the magical pink little pill, Benadryl. This was a pretty consistent habit for most of college, and I didn’t think much off it. A few close friends recently told me about a recent <a href="http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/common-anticholinergic-drugs-like-benadryl-linked-increased-dementia-risk-201501287667">study</a> that linked anticholinergic drugs like Benadryl to dementia. So, obviously the solution was to find a healthy alternative like Prozac or marijuana to help the trouble sleeping.</p>
  <br> <br><br>
  <p>Just kidding, I just continued taking Benadryl. After I moved to SF, it was even more difficult for me to fall asleep every night — I would stare at the ceiling for hours, before giving in and taking another little pink pill. One night, I was desperate for solutions and I found a beautiful iPhone application that said it would put you to sleep in 60 seconds.</p>
  <br><br>

  <br><br>
  <p>Half awake and delusional, I downloaded it. This is a demo of the app:
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KxFxbQWdUd4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
  <br><br>
  <p>As the video shows, the app requires you to be staring at the screen while you&rsquo;re supposedly falling asleep in 60 seconds.
    Extreme frustration came out of this, but also the impulse to build something similar to this application for the Amazon Echo. I hacked together a meditation application, or skill, for the Amazon Echo that walks users through sleeping and breathing meditations. You can find the source <a href="https://github.com/lilshim/hypnos">here</a>.</p>

  <br><br>

  <p>Developing the app was fairly straight forward. Finding tutorials and <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit/alexa-skill-quick-start-tutorial">documentation</a> for how to get things running with Amazon’s suite of products wasn’t difficult. There were a few frustrating parts:</p>
  <br><br>
  <ul>
    <li><p>1. Forcing the developer to use the developer dashboard to input JSON code for utterances, the intent schema, and custom slot types. Would have been a much smoother experience if I could upload my own files in a specific format for those.</p></li>
    <br><br>
    <li><p>2. I went through 3 rounds of certification reviews before I was approved, and sometimes I didn’t do anything to change a specific problem and it was resolved on the next review. It doesn’t look like I’m the only one <a href="https://github.com/AreYouFreeBusy/AlexaSkillsKit.NET/issues/5">experiencing this</a></p></li>
    <br><br>
    <li><p>3. Upon looking at the template python code, I thought that there must have been an easier way to organize and structure the code. Thankfully, I found <a href="https://github.com/johnwheeler/flask-ask">Flask-Ask</a>, and, having used Flask before, I found developing much more intuitive.</p></li>
  </ul>
  <br><br><br><br>
  <p>My app doesn’t actually help me with my sleeping troubles. In the process of building this I realized I should probably just accept that there isn’t a great technological solution to my sleeping problems. In fact, distancing myself from technology is probably the best solution for this problem — turning off the glowing rectangles for a little while before sleeping and taking a walk, reading, or hang out with friends have worked well for me lately.</p>
